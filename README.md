bub-multichar qbx-spawn Working

A multicharacter system built for [qbx_core](https://github.com/Qbox-project/qbx_core). The code is primarily just from [qbx_core](https://github.com/Qbox-project/qbx_core) own multicharacter, i have just added a UI using Mantine instead of using the [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib) functionalities which [qbx_core](https://github.com/Qbox-project/qbx_core) own multicharacter does.
